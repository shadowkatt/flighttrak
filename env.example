# FlightTrak Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and configure your settings

# ===== Location Settings =====
# Option 1: Use ZIP code (will be geocoded automatically)
ZIPCODE=10314

# Option 2: Use explicit coordinates (used if ZIPCODE is not set)
LATITUDE=40.6895
LONGITUDE=-74.1745

# ===== Flight Tracking Settings =====
# Search radius in miles (how far to look for flights)
# Smaller radius = fewer flights = lower costs
# Recommended: 3-5 miles for local area
SEARCH_RADIUS_MILES=5

# How often to poll for flights (in milliseconds)
# 30000 = 30 seconds (real-time updates)
# 60000 = 1 minute (balanced)
# 120000 = 2 minutes (cost-saving)
# 300000 = 5 minutes (very cost-saving)
POLL_INTERVAL=30000

# ===== FlightAware Enhanced Lookup =====
# FlightAware API Key (get from https://flightaware.com/commercial/aeroapi/)
# If present, FlightAware will enhance flights above the altitude threshold
# If not present or commented out, system runs in FREE mode (OpenSky only)
FLIGHTAWARE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Altitude threshold for FlightAware lookups (in feet)
# Only flights ABOVE this altitude will use FlightAware API (costs money)
# This filters out landing/departing flights which change rapidly
# 
# Recommended values:
#   1000 = More flights enhanced (higher cost ~$8-15/month)
#   2000 = Balanced - only stable cruising flights (lower cost ~$3-8/month)
#   3000 = Very selective (minimal cost ~$2-5/month)
#   0 = Disabled (same as removing FLIGHTAWARE_API_KEY)
# 
# Default: 2000 feet
FLIGHTAWARE_LOOKUP_ALTITUDE_FEET=2000

# ===== OpenSky Network Credentials =====
# Option 1: OAuth (Recommended - higher rate limits)
OPENSKY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
OPENSKY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret

# Option 2: Basic Auth (Alternative)
# OPENSKY_USERNAME=your_username
# OPENSKY_PASSWORD=your_password

# ===== Flightradar24 API =====
# Flightradar24 API Key (get from https://fr24api.flightradar24.com/)
# Alternative to FlightAware - use ONE or the other, not both
# Explorer Plan: $9/month for 30K credits
FLIGHTRADAR24_API_KEY=your_fr24_api_key_here

# Altitude threshold for Flightradar24 lookups (in feet)
# Same logic as FlightAware - only lookup flights above this altitude
# Default: 2000 feet
FLIGHTRADAR24_LOOKUP_ALTITUDE_FEET=2000

# ===== Enhanced API Provider Selection =====
# Choose which enhanced API to use: "flightaware" or "flightradar24"
# Only ONE will be active at a time (can be changed in UI)
# Default: flightradar24
ENHANCED_API_PROVIDER=flightradar24

# ===== Hybrid Mode (Auto-Switch) =====
# Set to "yes" to enable automatic switching between providers
# When enabled:
#   - Starts with FlightAware
#   - Auto-switches to Flightradar24 when FlightAware cost reaches $5
#   - UI selector is hidden (automatic mode)
# Set to "no" for manual provider selection via UI
# Default: no
HYBRID_MODE=no

# ===== Cost Management Tips =====
# To stay under $20/month with FlightAware:
#
# Budget Setup ($5-10/month):
#   SEARCH_RADIUS_MILES=3
#   POLL_INTERVAL=120000
#   FLIGHTAWARE_LOOKUP=true
#
# Free Setup ($0/month):
#   SEARCH_RADIUS_MILES=5
#   POLL_INTERVAL=30000
#   FLIGHTAWARE_LOOKUP=false
#
# Real-time Setup ($15-25/month):
#   SEARCH_RADIUS_MILES=5
#   POLL_INTERVAL=30000
#   FLIGHTAWARE_LOOKUP=true
